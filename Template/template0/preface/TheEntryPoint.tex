Set up a treasure hunt around your school and the school grounds. The clues that the children will be following are going to be photographs taken of various features around the school. Ensure that these are as interesting and quirky as possible. For example, you might take a close-up photograph of a clock, a particular tree, a feature of a stone wall, a reflection on the school pond and so on. The idea of the game is for the children to explore their environment, noticing the things that they might not always pay attention to.
Hang or place a plastic bag with letter cards inside or close to each location. If the children find each one they will collect all the letters to help them spell out the words ‘Our World’ (or a different word or phrase of your choice).
Explain to the children that they are going on a special treasure hunt around their school. Be sure to explain the boundaries of the hunt (where the children can and can’t go) and outline any rules (e.g. all members of a group must stay together at all times and so on).
Divide the class into groups for the hunt. Give each group the photograph cards.
Explain that these are their clues. At each location they will find a letter. Each group should take one of the letters. Once the groups have all eight letters, they should return to the classroom to try to spell out their phrase.
Allow time for the children to look closely at the photographs and discuss possible locations. Some groups might want to plan the route that they are going to take to collect their letters. Then give the signal to start – the hunt is on!
When the children return to the classroom, ask them to spread out their letters. Explain that the letters will spell out two words. If children are struggling then you might want to give them some clues. (‘It’s all around us. It’s all about where we live.’)
Afterwards, ask the children to talk about the features and details in each photograph that helped them to find their letters. Which clues were the most difficult to find? Did the children discover anything new about their environment while on their treasure hunt?
